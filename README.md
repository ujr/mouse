# Unit Mouse

A very long time ago, I apparently did concern myself with using
the mouse from Turbo Pascal programs. Here are some files that were
recovered by a recent cleanup: the Pascal Unit [mouse.pas](mouse.pas)
(documentation in [mouse.txt](mouse.txt)) that offers functionality
for using a Microsoft compatible mouse (via a mouse driver), along
with some sample programs. Note the 8.3 convention (limitation) for
file names of MS-DOS. The gitignore file excludes the compiled (.exe
and .tpu) artifacts.

I guess that the book *PC intern* by Michael Tischer deserves some
credit here: at least it got me hooked to “systems programming” on
the IBM PC. See also <https://www.mitinet.de>
